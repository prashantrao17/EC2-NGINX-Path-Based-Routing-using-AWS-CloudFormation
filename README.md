NGINX Path-Based Routing on AWS using CloudFormation

📌 Overview

This mini project demonstrates how to deploy an Amazon EC2 instance using AWS CloudFormation and configure NGINX to perform path-based routing for multiple URLs representing planets in the solar system.

Each route (for example /earth, /mars) serves a different static HTML page, all hosted on a single EC2 instance.
